# 2.0.0 (2022-02-01)
## SvelteKit packaging
See: https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#packaging   
Since v2, SvelteKit is used to develop the components and generate the package.
The generated package can be found under the `./package` directory.

## Important! Since v2, the import statement syntax is different    
v1.x: `import TimePicker from 'svelte-time-picker';`    
v2: `import {TimePicker} from 'svelte-time-picker';`

## Changed
- fix: TypeScript support (issue #5).
- fix: `OpenTo` value used when reopening the component (issue #7).

- BREAKING CHANGE: the package is generated by SvelteKit. See before.
